# TF_KNN

This repository contains TensorFlow KNN Ops based on CPU(KDTree) and GPU(CUDA) respectively. CUDA version is a modification of [KNN-CUDA](https://github.com/vincentfpgarcia/kNN-CUDA), KDTree version is based on [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann). 

There is also a pure tensorflow implementation of KNN in `demo.py`, yet it can easily get OOM when handling large scale pointcloud (basically the reason why I create this repository) as a distance matrix with the size of \[batch_size, num_points, num_queries\] need to be stored in VRAM (however, it is still faster than mine CUDA implementation when available, ðŸ¥º).

Notes:
- The GPU version is very sensitive to K, larger K may cause the computation time grows dramatically. 
- The CPU version is the dominator during time test, which I insist to use instead of CUDA or pure TensorFlow version.

# Usage

Both version has the same way to build Op (yet for GPU version you may need to change the `CUDA_HOME` in `compile.sh` first):
1. run `compile.sh` in CUDA or KDTree folder.
2. import the knn_grouping function in `knn_grouping.py`.
3. use `tf.gather` with `batch_dims=1' to gather the NN via returned indices.
